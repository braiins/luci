<p><%:The prototype has limited capabilities:%></p>
<ul>
  <li><%:it only uses 1 hashboard of the S9%></li>
  <li><%:it doesn't have an API%></li>
  <li><%:AsicBoost is enabled by default, it can be turned off by%> <em>--disable-asic-boost</em></li>
</ul>
<p><%:How to run it:%></p>
<pre>ssh root@<%=hostname%>
root@<%=hostname%>:~# bosminer [FLAGS] --pool &lt;HOSTNAME:PORT&gt; --user &lt;USERNAME.WORKERNAME&gt;</pre>
<p><%:Full options:%></p>
<pre>bosminer -h</pre>
<p><%:You can connect the miner to our Stratum V2 endpoint:%></p>
<pre>bosminer --pool v2.stratum.slushpool.com:3336 --user &lt;USERNAME.WORKERNAME&gt;</pre>
<p><%:If you want to connect the miner to your own pool, you have to run a V2%>&rarr;<%:V1 translating proxy locally. To compile and install the proxy, please follow these instructions:%></p>
